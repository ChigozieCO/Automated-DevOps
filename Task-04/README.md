# Task 

Write an Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC) script using Terraform to provision AWS resources (EC2,
S3, RDS)

# Implementation

For this task, I will use AWS community modules in my Terraform script. DevOps is about efficiency, automation, and reducing manual overhead. There's no need to reinvent the wheel when well-maintained modules already exist to streamline infrastructure provisioning.
